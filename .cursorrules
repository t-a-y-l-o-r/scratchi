# Python Project Cursor Rules

## Language and Style
- Use Python 3.12 features (type hints, match/case, structural pattern matching)
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines strictly
- Use type hints for all function signatures and class attributes
- Prefer f-strings over .format() or % formatting
- Use pathlib.Path instead of os.path for file operations
- Use dataclasses or Pydantic models for data structures
- Prefer list/dict/set comprehensions when they improve readability

## Code Quality
- Always add type hints using typing module or built-in types (list[str], dict[str, int], etc.)
- Use mypy for type checking (configured in pyproject.toml)
- Use ruff for linting and formatting (faster than black/flake8)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters (unless the project specifies otherwise)
- Use descriptive variable names - never use single letter variables unless explicitly asked to
- Use Enums and constants (CONST) instead of magic values - avoid hardcoded strings, numbers, or boolean values in code
- Enums should also be used for key mappings (dictionary keys, column names, etc.) to prevent typos and improve maintainability
- Add docstrings to all public functions, classes, and modules (Google or NumPy style)
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer guard statements and early returns over deep nesting to improve readability
- Prefer composition over inheritance where possible

## Error Handling
- Use specific exception types, avoid bare `except:` clauses
- Use context managers (with statements) for resource management
- Raise meaningful exceptions with descriptive error messages
- Use typing.Protocol for structural subtyping instead of ABC when appropriate

## Logging
- Always use the `logging` module instead of `print()` statements
- Create module-level loggers using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`
- Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Include contextual information in log messages (use structured logging when beneficial)
- Configure logging at the application entry point, not in library code

## Dependencies
- Prefer standard library solutions when possible
- Use pyproject.toml for dependency management (PEP 517/518)
- Pin dependency versions in requirements files for reproducibility
- Add comments explaining non-obvious dependency choices

## Testing
- Write tests for all public functions and classes
- Use pytest as the testing framework
- Place tests in `tests/` directory mirroring the source structure
- Use fixtures for test setup/teardown
- Aim for high test coverage but prioritize meaningful tests over coverage metrics
- Use pytest.mark.parametrize for testing multiple scenarios

## Documentation
- Include docstrings in Google or NumPy style format
- Document complex algorithms or business logic with inline comments
- Keep README.md updated with setup instructions and usage examples
- Document all public APIs

## Performance
- Profile before optimizing
- Use generators and generator expressions for memory efficiency
- Consider using async/await for I/O-bound operations
- Use appropriate data structures (sets for membership testing, deque for queues)

## Project Structure
- Use `src/` layout for packages (src/project_name/)
- Keep the main package code in src/
- Place CLI scripts in a `scripts/` or use package entry points
- Use __init__.py to control public API (__all__ exports)
- Keep configuration separate from code (use config files or environment variables)

## Imports
- Group imports: stdlib, third-party, local (separated by blank lines)
- Use absolute imports for project code
- Avoid relative imports except within package internals
- Never use `from __future__ import annotations` unless explicitly asked to

## Git and Version Control
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Write clear commit messages in imperative mood
- Don't commit __pycache__, .pyc files, or virtual environments
- Use .gitignore appropriately (already configured)

## Security
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Be cautious with eval(), exec(), and pickle

## Modern Python Features
- Use match/case statements for pattern matching (Python 3.12)
- Use typing.Generic and typing.TypeVar for generic types
- Prefer typing.Protocol over ABC for structural subtyping
- Use dataclasses.dataclass or typing.NamedTuple for simple data containers
- Use typing.Literal for string/enum-like types
- Use | operator (Python 3.12) for union types
- Use enum.Enum or enum.StrEnum (Python 3.11+) for enumerated constants instead of string literals

## When Making Changes
- Always run linters (ruff) before committing
- Ensure type checking passes (mypy)
- Run tests before committing changes
- Update documentation when changing APIs
- Consider backward compatibility for library code
